/* 
Questions for Brendan:
1. ViewComponents/Buttons and ViewComponents/ViewComponents?
 Answer: These just contain elements, or views, that can be dropped in elsewhere. Such as buttons with certain colors.
2. Views/Feed/Index/FooterRefreshControl?
 Answer: The collection view, which the Feed is made from, has a footer which is used to load in new content. When it's in view, 
        the next API call is triggered.
